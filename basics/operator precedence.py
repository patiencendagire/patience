#OPERATOR PRECEDENCE.
#This is an operator that determines the order in which the operators 
#are to be executed prioritizing their importance.
#Operators of a higher precedence are executed first.
#Examples,
# result_one=3*4+5
# print(result_one)

# result_two=3*(4+5)
# print(result_two)

# result_three=3*4+5-1
# print(result_three)

# result_four=3*(4+5)-1
# print(result_four)

#Example 2
# What be the outcome of the following expressions:
# result_five=5*3**2
# print(result_five)

# result_six=(5+3)*2**2-10/2
# print(result_six)

num=25/5+2*1
print(num)

num1=(25/5)+2*1
print(num1)
